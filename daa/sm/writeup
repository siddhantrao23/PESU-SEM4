String matching is the process of finding a substring within a string.

Functions implemented:

Description of searchFirstOccurrence
=====================================
Declaration: int searchFirstOccurrence(char *pattern, char *text);

searchFirstOccurrence finds the first occurance of the pattern in the text by iterating
through the text from o to n-m. It returns -1 if the pattern isn't found and the offset
of the substring if found.

Description of searchLastOccurrence  
=====================================
Declaration: int searchLastOccurrence(char *pattern, char *text);

searchLastOccurrence finds the last occurance of the pattern in the text by iterating
through the text from n-m uptil 0. It returns -1 if the pattern isn't found and the offset
of the substring if found.

int numOccurrences(char *pattern, char *text);

int longestPrefix(char *pattern, char *text);

int charactersCompared(char *pattern, char *text);

Sorting is a technique to arrange data in either increasing or decreasing order

Desciption of isSorted
==============================

Declaration: int isSorted(int *a, int n);

The function iterates through the entire array and compares all adjacent
elements and returns false if the first element is greater than the second

Desciption of bubblePass
==============================

Declaration: void bubblePass(int *a, int n);

The function iterates through the array and swaps two adjacent elements if the
first element is greater than the second


Desciption of bubbleSort
==============================

Declaration: void bubbleSort(int *a, int n);

Performs bubble sort by repeatedly calling bubblePass but with a smaller (n-i)
length array where i ranges from 0 to n


Desciption of numBubblePasses
==============================

Declaration: int numBubblePasses(int *a, int n);

Finds the minimum number of passes required to sort by using the bubble sort
algorithm. This is done by checking in every iteration if the array is sorted
and incrementing the count for every iteration.


Description of maxIndex
==============================

Declaration: int maxIndex(int *a, int n);

Sequential sort is a sorting technique used to find an occurance of
the given key in an array.

Functions implemented:

Description of searchFirstOccurrence
=====================================

Decleration: int searchFirstOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key);

searchFirstOccurrence searches for the given key in the array by iterating
through the array from beginning to end i.e. 0 to n and checking if the key
is present. It returns the index of the key if found and -1 otherwise.


Description of searchLastOccurrence
====================================

Decleration: int searchLastOccurrence(int arr[], int n, int key);

searchLastOccurrence searches for the given key in the array by iterating
through the array from the end to the beginning i.e. n-1 to 0 and checking
if the key is present. It returns the index of the key if found and -1 otherwise


Description of numOccurrences
==============================

Decleration: int numOccurrences(int arr[], int n, int key);

numOccurrences performs sequential search on the array for the key and increments
a counter everytime the key is found in the array. This count is then returned.
